# text to speech processing for Sanskrit

absolutely experimental !

To spell an arbitrary Sanskrit word, DB should contain 3000-5000 uniq syllables approximately, I believe.

Gita has 30 000 syllables approx.

So, mapping Gita to sound can not be accomplished without volunteers help.

If you can help, select any sloka you like map and write me: m.bykov@gmail.com

NB: Morpheus text-to-speech processor uses traditional definition of syllable, so each syllable ends with vowel or anusvara (or nasal) and starts with consonant or consonant cluster
