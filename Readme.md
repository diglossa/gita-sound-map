# text to speech processing for Sanskrit

absolutely experimental !

To play arbitrary Sanskrit sound, DB should contain 3000-5000 uniq syllables approximately, I believe.

Gita has 30 000 syllables approx.

So, mapping Gita to sound can not be accomplished without volunteers help.

If you can help, select any sloka you like and write me: m.bykov@gmail.com
